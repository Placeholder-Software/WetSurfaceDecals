# Requirements

Wet Stuff requires cameras which are configured with `Rendering Path: Deferred`. It will _not_ work in any other rendering pipelines.

# Not Supported

Currently the SRP renderers (URP and HDRP) are **not** supported. If you're interested in support for one of these renderers please email [mailto://admin@placeholder-software.co.uk](mailto://admin@placeholder-software.co.uk) to register your interest.
