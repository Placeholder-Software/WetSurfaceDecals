Wet Stuff allow you to place deferred decals into the scene which project "wetness" onto surfaces within their volume.

Define complex layered and animated decals to simulate rain, puddles, damp, leaking pipes, and more - without making any modifications to any of your assets or replacing shaders. Allow your artists to drastically change the atmosphere of your scene in seconds with artist placed decals, or generate decals dynamically by attaching them to particle collision points automatically.
